Title: README-File-Generator

Description: This is a README file generator that uses the command line to generate a README file for a project. The user is prompted with questions about their project and the answers are used to generate the README file that is outputted for the user to use. This project is a mixture of knowledge gained from the UCF Bootcamp class, Node.js, and the Inquirer package. 

Installation: To install this project, the user must clone the repository from GitHub (The link where you are reading this). The user must have Node.js installed. Once you are in the repository, run the command "npm install" to install the necessary packages and dependencies. After that, all you need to do is run the command "node index.js" and answer the questions that are prompted to you.

Usage: Once 'node index.js' is run, the user will be prompted with questions about their project. The user must answer the questions (with detail relevant to their project only) and once all questions are answered, the README file will be generated and placed inside of the folder named 'output'. The user can then copy the README file and place it in their project folder.

Contribution: Ryan Arnold is the sole contributor to this project.

Tests: There is an example README file in the 'output' folder that was generated using this project. This is the same README that was placed inside of the Walkthrough project and is based on Project 1: TrackerCoaster. Screenshots are placed to example the output of the README.md too!
